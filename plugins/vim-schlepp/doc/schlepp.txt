SCHLEPP MOVEMENT                                              *schlepp-movement*

These are intended to be the most frequently used commands. They work in
|linewise-visual| and |blockwise-visual| modes. Regular visual mode is not
supported at the moment, but may be supported in the future. Once text is
selected, you can freely move it around your file, and text will reflow around
the selection being moved, based on the |visual-mode| being used.

In |blockwise-visual| mode, |schlepp| will automatically remove trailing
whitespace from selections, due to its use of 'virtualedit' settings adding
lots of whitespace in many cases, it tries to clean up after itself, but may
inadvertently remove intentional whitespace. See |schlepp-trim-ws| to change
the default.

                                                             *schlepp-move-cmds*
Command               Action ~
<Plug>*SchleppUp*       Moves selected text up 1 line.
<Plug>*SchleppDown*     Moves selected text down 1 line.
<Plug>*SchleppLeft*     Moves selected text to the left 1 char. By default will
                      not allow text to be "squished" to the left upon hitting
                      the left most column. See |schlepp-squishing-lines| and
                      |schlepp-squishing-blocks|.

<Plug>*SchleppRight*    Moves selected text to the right 1 char.

                                                         *schlepp-move-mappings*
The recommended mappings are. >
    vmap <unique> <up>    <Plug>SchleppUp
    vmap <unique> <down>  <Plug>SchleppDown
    vmap <unique> <left>  <Plug>SchleppLeft
    vmap <unique> <right> <Plug>SchleppRight
<

                                                              *schlepp-reindent*
Additionally when moving text |schlepp| can automatically use vim's reindent
command as text is moved, making moving code around really easy (assuming your
indentation style matches vim's).
Note: This only works in |linewise-visual| mode.

Command                             Action ~
<Plug>*SchleppToggleReindent*         Used to toggle reindentation mode on and
                                    off. Default off. See
                                    |schlepp-toggle-reindent|
<Plug>*SchleppIndentUp*               Moves selection up, and reindents.
<Plug>*SchleppIndentDown*             Moves selection down, and reindents.

Using Shift with up or down works pretty well, but not all terminals will send
shifted arrows. In GVIM this should work. >
    vmap <unique> <S-up>   <Plug>SchleppIndentUp
    vmap <unique> <S-down> <Plug>SchleppIndentDown
<
But I like to just map the toggle function. >
    vmap <unique> i <Plug>SchleppToggleReindent
<
Some behaviors when moving text can be changed with a couple settings.

==============================================================================
SCHLEPP DUPLICATION                                        *schlepp-duplication*

While text is selected, it can be duplicated in one of a couple directions.
|linewise-visual| lets you duplicate above or below the selected text, and
|blockwise-visual| allows any of the four directions. By default |schlepp| will
strip any trailing whitespace from the newly placed text.

                                                              *schlepp-dup-cmds*
Command                 Action ~
<Plug>*SchleppDup*        Duplicates the selected text in the default direction,
                        below for |linewise-visual| and to the right for
                        |blockwise-visual|. The defaults can be changed,
                        |schlepp-options|

<Plug>*SchleppDupUp*      Duplicates the selected text and places it above the
                        current selection.

<Plug>*SchleppDupDown*    Duplicates the selected text and places it below the
                        current selection. This is the |linewise-visual|
                        default. See |schlepp-dup-lines| to change default.

<Plug>*SchleppDupLeft*    Duplicates the selected text and places it to the left
                        of the current selection. Only works in
                        |blockwise-visual|.

<Plug>*SchleppDupRight*   Duplicates the selected text and places it to the
                        right of the current selection. Only works, and is the
                        default in |blockwise-visual|. See |schlepp-dup-block|
                        to change default.



                                                          *schlepp-dup-mappings*
If you want just the basic dupliction behavior, and are happy with always
duplicating in the same direction then the following may be a decent mapping. >
    vmap <unique> D <Plug>SchleppDup
<

If you want the fine grained control over duplication direction. The following
may be more appealing. >
    vmap <unique> Dk <Plug>SchleppDupUp
    vmap <unique> Dj <Plug>SchleppDupDown
    vmap <unique> Dh <Plug>SchleppDupLeft
    vmap <unique> Dl <Plug>SchleppDupRight
<

SCHLEPP OPTIONS                                            *schlepp-configuring*
                                                               *schlepp-options*

Any of the following options can be set in your |vimrc| if you would like to
change them from the default.

Option                          Default     Behavior ~
*g:Schlepp#allowSquishingLines*   0           *schlepp-squishing-lines*
*g:Schlepp#allowSquishingBlock*   0           *schlepp-squishing-block*
                                            Enabling will let lines/blocks
                                            with leading spaces move left,
                                            even when other lines in the
                                            selection cannot move left.

*g:Schlepp#trimWS*                1           *schlepp-trim-ws*
                                            Disabling prevents schlepp from
                                            removing trailing whitespace in
                                            |blockwise-visual| selections
                                            after movement.

*g:Schlepp#reindent*              0           *schlepp-toggle-reindent*
                                            Enabling will make schlepp, by
                                            default, auto-reindent text when
                                            moving.
                                            NOTE: Only in |linewise-visual|

*g:Schlepp#useShiftWidthLines*    0           *schlepp-use-shiftwidth-lines*
                                            Enabling will make schlepp use |<|
                                            or |>| when moving lines left or
                                            right.
                                            NOTE: Ignores
                                            |g:Schlepp#allowSquishing|
                                            Enabling will let lines/blocks with
                                            leading spaces move left, even
                                            when other lines in the selection
                                            cannot move left.
                                            setting

*g:Schlepp#dupTrimWS*             0           *schlepp-dup-trim-ws*
                                            Enabling will make schlepp trim
                                            trailing whitespace from newly
                                            duplicated text. Default is off
                                            since this really isn't a common
                                            problem, and it slows down the
                                            operation slightly if its enabled.

*g:Schlepp#dupLinesDir*           "down"      *schlepp-dup-lines*
                                            Only other valid direction is
                                            "up". Changes the default behavior
                                            of |SchleppDup| in
                                            |linewise-visual| mode.

*g:Schlepp#dupBlockDir*           "right"     *schlepp-dup-block*
                                            Valid directions are "up", "down",
                                            "right", and "left". Changes the
                                            default behavior of |SchleppDup|
                                            in |blockwise-visual| mode.

CHANGELOG                                                    *schlepp-changelog*

v1.0.1
    Realized that a dictionary cannot be used for user settings without being
    imposing on users.
v1.0.0
    After fixing many little issues schlepp is now in its first ready state,
    and is ready to be abused by vim users (I hope).
pre1.0.0
    Wow who would have thought moving selected text around would have this
    many problems. If you really want to see the progress look at the commit
    history.

Schlepp was originally wrote by Zachary Stigall after being frustrated with
the poor performance and bugginess of Damian Conway's DragVisuals. The
wonderful people who have contributed to make this even better are listed
below. Also thanks to my friends who listened to me rant endlessly about
little issues and for providing feedback and testing for features.

    Well this is embarrassing...
