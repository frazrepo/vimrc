# Lightning
A light colorscheme for vim based on [Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice/) by Romain Lafourcade.
It has 16 and 256 colours support for both terminal and GUI.

[NOTE]
This is a work in progress.

## Screenshots
All screenshots are taken in VIM cli on a 256-colour enabled terminal (rxvt-unicode-256color).
