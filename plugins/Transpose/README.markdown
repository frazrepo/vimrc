This is a vim plugin that helps you transpose (in the sense of matrix
transposition) blocks of text, words, delimited text, or lines that you can
tokenize with a custom pattern.

vim-transpose is written in pure VimL (no need for Python nor Perl).

![Transposition examples](https://github.com/salsifis/vim-transpose/blob/master/screenshots/demo.png?raw=true)

Commands
--------
Five commands are provided:

 * `:Transpose` (for character array transposition),
 * `:TransposeWords` (for word array transposition),
 * `:TransposeTab` (for tab-separated table transposition),
 * `:TransposeCSV` (for general delimited text transposition), and
 * `:TransposeInteractive` (for custom transposition).

An additional variable, `g:transpose_keepindent` controls whether the plugin
should detect indentation of the range. The `:TransposeIndentToggle` command
will toggle this variable.

Installation
------------

If you have the Pathogen plugin installed or any other plugin manager, then
just copy this filetree into a subfolder of your Bundle folder.

Otherwise, copy the contents of the `doc/`, `plugin/` and `autoload/` folders
to resp.  `~/.vim/doc`, `~/.vim/plugin` and `~/.vim/autoload` respectively.

Getting started
---------------

After having built help tags (run `:Helptags` if you have pathogen installed)
run `:help transpose-tutorial`, and follow the instructions. If you don't have
pathogen installed and don't know how to build the help tags, just open
`doc/transpose.txt` inside vim.

Example use cases
-----------------

This plugin can be useful:

 * When you have tabular data (for example, pasted from a spreadsheet
   application) and you need to remove or swap columns: using regular
   expressions should be more difficult than using `:TransposeTab`, perform the
   operations on lines instead of columns, and `:TransposeTab` again.
 * When you need to ensure that tabular data has a consistent number of
   columns: since transposition will create missing fields such that it
   operates on a rectangular matrix, running twice a `:Transpose`â€¦ command will
   create the missing fields.
