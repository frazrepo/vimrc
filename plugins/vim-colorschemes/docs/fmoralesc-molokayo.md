# molokayo

A very tweaked molokai based theme. Has 16bit and 256 colors support.

Includes support for [vim-buftabline](https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline).

Includes some syntax groups for coloring the statusline (see the screenshots
below, and
[here](https://github.com/fmoralesc/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc#L209-L255) for
the config used in them).

It also includes a matching configuration for `guicursor`, which I use as a
mode indicator.

## Installation

molokayo requires the [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai/) theme to be 
installed.

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): 

~~~ vim 
Plug 'tomasr/molokai'
Plug 'fmoralesc/molokayo'
~~~

Vundle, Neobundle *et al* should be similar.
